# Blockchain Assignment (CS4262-Distributed Systems)

### Concepts learnt about blockchains

1. **Decentralized Consensus** - A blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer system that does not have a central authority to control the exchange of information. The nodes in a blockchain network come to an agreement using consensus algorithms to make decisions. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.

2. **Smart Contracts** - These are digital contracts which are the building blocks for blockchain-based applications. A user can set up pre-determined rules in a smart contract. After the execution of the pre-determined rules, payments are automatically released by the smart contract to all the participants in the contract.
